For the Computational Musicology course at the UvA


My corpus consists of Rammstein's 8 studio albums and their Rarit√§ten (1994-2012) compilation album, as well as Spotify's Industrial Metal playlist. I chose Rammstein because of my personal interest in the band. I thought it would be interesting to choose this as my corpus because in the Industrial Metal scene the newer Rammstein albums are not seen as true industrial metal by some, stating that only the older albums can really be called industrial metal.
My plan is to compare Rammstein's albums to the Industrial Metal playlist to see how industrial Rammsteins albums truly are, and wether or not the older albums are more industrial than the newer ones.
I believe Spotify's Industrial Metal playlist is a good representation of what most fans of the genre would call industrial metal. The playlist is however limited in the fact that Spotify's playlist includes songs released in the 90's as well as songs that have been released fairly recently, meaning that it will be difficult to compared the albums to "classic" or "new" industrial metal songs.
