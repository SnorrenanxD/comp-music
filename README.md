My corpus consists of Rammstein's 8 studio albums and their Rarit√§ten (1994-2012) compilation album, as well as Spotify's Industrial Metal playlist. I chose Rammstein because of my personal interest in the band. I thought it would be interesting to choose this as my corpus because in the Industrial Metal scene the newer Rammstein albums are not seen as true industrial metal by some, stating that only the older albums can really be called industrial metal.

My plan is to compare Rammstein's albums to the Industrial Metal playlist to see how industrial Rammsteins albums truly are, and wether or not the older albums are more industrial than the newer ones.

I believe Spotify's Industrial Metal playlist is a good representation of what most fans of the genre would call industrial metal. The playlist is however limited in the fact that Spotify's playlist includes songs released in the 90's as well as songs that have been released fairly recently, meaning that it will be difficult to compared the albums to "classic" or "new" industrial metal songs.

Typical industrial metal songs in the corpus: 
<br>Rammstein: "Feuer frei!", "Du Hast", "Du riechst so gut", "Giftig" - These songs are seen as staples of the industrial metal genre, with the exception of "Giftig", which has a very industrial metal sound but has only been released recently.
<br>Other: "Wish" by Nine Inch Nails, "The Beautiful People" by Marilyn Manson, "Hey Man, Nice Shot" by Filter, "The Death & Resurrection Show" by Killing Joke - These songs are some of the most popular industrial metal songs of their time, if Rammstein is left out of the equation.

Atypical songs in the corpus: 
<br>Rammstein: "Diamant", "Stirb nicht vor mir (Don't Die Before I Do)", "Ein Lied", "Ohne Dich" - These songs are mostly ballads or calm, quiet songs not typically associated with industrial metal out of the context of Rammstein.
<br>Other: "ISN'T EVERYONE" by HEALTH and Nine Inch Nails, "Modern Demon" by Combichrist - These songs are in the Industrial Metal playlist, but consist of more synthesizer parts and less distorted guitars than most industrial metal songs.

I think my plot is interesting because it shows the defining features of popular industrial metal songs. The x axis shows the popularity, the y axis shows the danceability, the size shows the energy, and the color shows the release date.
